I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca
) at the University of Toronto in [Prof. Gillian Hadfield](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/gillian-k-hadfield/)'s group and affiliated with the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

My research focuses on multi-agent systems, empirical game theory, and other computational methods for safety in AI systems; both at the level of a specific application as well as society. Often this falls under the umbrella of [Cooperative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08630.pdf?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=idealist) spanning the following themes:

- Theories of bounded rationality and methods for modelling behaviour for human-AI interactions.
- Role of norms, beliefs, and information in 'AI and society' (e.g., online social systems)
- Safety of automated systems that interact with humans (e.g. self-driving cars).

I received my PhD from David R Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.  You can check out my thesis [here](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/18751). 

Prior to starting grad school, I spent eight years working in industry, most of which was at IBM Software Labs in India.

=======

**(May 2024)** New paper! Drawing from human social structures of norms and institutions, our new paper shows how to design LLM-based generative agents that have capacity for cooperative behaviour. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19328)

**(Feb 2024)** New paper out on arxiv with insights on opinion and rhetoric expression in online social systems. <br>
_Main takeaway:_ When there is ideological polarization within a population, ideological institutions (e.g., partisan media) can distort beliefs about the outgroup population to move the expressed opinion to one extreme. Affective polarization is a by-product of this dynamic. In other words, "Institutions matter" - in online social systems too. [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06264)
