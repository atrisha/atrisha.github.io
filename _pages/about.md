Hi, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca
) at the University of Toronto in [Prof. Gillian Hadfield](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/gillian-hadfield/)'s group. 

My research focuses on multi-agent systems, game theory, and the computational tools required to ensure safety and fairness of AI applications, both at the level of a specific application as well as society. I am interested in studying conflicts that may arise as AI integrates further into human societies, and believe in taking a multi-disciplinary approach to resolving that problem. During my PhD I focused on one such domain: autonomous vehicles and their interaction with human drivers.

I received my PhD from David R Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I developed game-theoretic models of naturalistic human driving behaviour that can capture the diversity of human driving, as well as augment them with rare and edge-case scenarios often not observed in the observational data. These methods are useful in several phases of autonomous vehicle development, including testing, verification, and behaviour planning. 

Through my research, I am interested in answering

- What are the methodological challenges in modelling multi-agent environments where some of the agents act in a possibly boundedly rational and/or a semi co-operative setting?
- What assumptions should an AI agent make about other humans during interactions? What are the implications of those assumptions?
- How can we communicate decisions made by an AI in a way that is understood by governments, regulators, as well as society at large?

Prior to starting grad school, I spent eight years working in industry, most of which was at IBM Software Labs in India.
