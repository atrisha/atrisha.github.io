Hi, I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at University of Waterloo, Canada.
My research focuses broadly on the interaction between humans and AI driven autonomous systems, such as, self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (AVs). 

The motivation of my research is making AI systems safe and equitable for real world applications, especially when they interact with humans. Specifically, I am interested in answering 

- How we can model multi-agent environments where some of the agents are humans acting in a bounded-rational and semi co-operative setting.
- What assumptions an AI agent makes about other humans when we design these systems, and the impacts of those assumptions.
- How we can communicate decisions made by an AI in an way that is understood by people including governments, regulators, as well as people without deep technical expertise.

Prior to starting grad school, I spent eight years working in industry, most of which was at IBM Software Labs in India.
